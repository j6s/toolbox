#textcache
---
##What is this?
This is a script to cache text, for example as generated by a API call. 

##How to use this
There are 3 functions in this class: One to check, if a Cache exists, one to write the cache and one to read it.

In this example you can see this at work. Everything you need to know should be explained in the comments.

```
// the directory, where the cache is located, make shire you have write permissions here
$cache_dir = "content/cache/";

// the lifetime of your cache in seconds. In this example: 3 days
$lifetime = 60*60*24*3;

// In this example we want to parse a ODT file. Of course this is dependent on what you want to do. No matter what: we need a hash, that will be the filename
// In this example i am using the file hash of the file. This is recommended for this kind of operations cause it will automatically update, when you change the file
$file = "test/123.odt";
$hash = md5_file($file);

$textcache = new \toolbox\textcache($cache_dir,$lifetime);

if($textcache->exists($hash)){
	// if the cache exists, just read it
	$out = $textcache->read($hash);
} else {
	// if the cache does not exist or is to old, then create the content
	$out = \parser\ODTParserclass::parse($file);
	
	// and write it into a cache
	$textcache->create($hash,$out)
}
echo $out


```

_this example suspects you have a autoloader for namespaces, if you haven't you either have to include the file textcache.php or you can use my autoloader class (can be found at http://github.com/thephpjo/toolbox/)_
